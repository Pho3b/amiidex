## Want to add a new barcode?

I have used [UPCITEMDB.com](https://www.upcitemdb.com/) to search for amiibo barcodes. But the [AmiiDex barcodes database](https://github.com/cbonello/amiidex/blob/master/assets/json/lineup.json) is definitely not exhaustive.

If you wish to add a missing barcode, please raise a pull request or send me an email at [Email](mailto:amiidex.app@gmail.com) mentioning the missing barcode. 

## Things to keep in mind while raising a pull request.
